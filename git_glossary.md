Clone "A "clone" is a full copy of a Git repository that lives on your computer (or a codespace) instead of on GitHub. Cloning copies all files, commit history, and branches from the remote so you can edit locally and push or pull changes."--copilot summary from git hub docs.

Fork

Branch

Commit: "A "commit" records changes to one or more files in your branch", "similar to saving a file that's been editted." Each commit is given a "unique ID, called an SHA or hash." This is used to identify the "specific changes, when they were made, and who made the changes."
